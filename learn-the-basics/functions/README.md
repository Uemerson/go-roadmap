# Functions

A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a specific task. At a high level, a function takes an input and returns an output.

Function allows you to extract commonly used block of code into a single component.

**The single most popular Go function is main(), which is used in every independent Go program.**

A declaration begins with the func keyword, followed by the name you want the function to have, a pair of parentheses (), and then a block containing the function's code.
