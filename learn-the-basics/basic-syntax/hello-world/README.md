# About

With this program we can run and build basic Go program

# Instructions

To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.

```
$ go run hello-world.go
Hello World!
```

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

```
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
go.mod  hello-world  hello-world.go  README.md
```

Now you can then execute the built binary directly.

```
$ ./hello-world
Hello World!
```
