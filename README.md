# About this repository

In this repository, the goal is to gather texts, examples, and other resources aligned with the Go Developer Roadmap found on the website [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/golang).

Navigating through the repositories, you will find a README.md containing the information I gathered about the topic, along with other available resources.
